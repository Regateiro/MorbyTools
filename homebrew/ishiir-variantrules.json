As noted in the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB}, you normally don't know that a spell has been cast unless the spell produces a noticeable effect.",

To be perceptible, the casting of a spell must involve a verbal, somatic, or material component. The form of a material component doesn't matter for the purposes of perception, whether it's an object specified in the spell's description, a component pouch, or a spellcasting focus.",
						"If the need for a spell's components has been removed by a special ability, such as the sorcerer's Subtle Spell feature or the Innate Spellcasting trait possessed by many creatures, the casting of the spell is imperceptible.

						"If the character perceived the casting, the spell's effect, or both, the character can make an Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check with their reaction or action. The DC equals 15 + the spell's level. If the spell is cast as a class spell and the character is a member of that class, the check is made with advantage. For example, if the spellcaster casts a spell as a cleric, another cleric has advantage on the check to identify the spell. Some spells aren't associated with any class when they're cast, such as when a monster uses its Innate Spellcasting trait.",
						"This Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check represents the fact that identifying a spell requires a quick mind and familiarity with the theory and practice of casting.

Being adjacent to the edge of the template isn't enough for a square to be included in the area of effect; the square must be entirely or partly covered by the template.",
