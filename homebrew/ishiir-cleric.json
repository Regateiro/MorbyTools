                "The Order Domain represents discipline, as well as devotion to a society or an institution and strict obedience to the laws governing it. On Ravnica, the domain is favored by clerics of the Azorius Senate, who use it to maintain and enforce the law, and of the Orzhov Syndicate, who exploit law and order for their personal gain. On other worlds, gods who grant access to this domain include {@deity Bane}, {@deity Tyr}, {@deity Majere|Dragonlance}, {@deity Erathis|Dawn War|DMG}, {@deity Pholtus|Greyhawk}, {@deity Wee Jas|Greyhawk}, {@deity Aureon|Eberron}, {@deity Maglubiyet|Nonhuman}, {@deity Nuada|Celtic}, {@deity Athena|Greek}, {@deity Anubis|Egyptian}, {@deity Forseti|Norse}, and {@deity Asmodeus|Dawn War|DMG}.",

Clerics of order are typically concerned with how things are done, rather than whether an action's results are just. Following the law and obeying its edicts is critical, especially when it benefits these clerics and their guilds or deities.",
